# Personal Compass Mobile App - MVP Project Plan

> **Project Rule:** The project has all major folders already created for scalable development. Files for features, components, and logic will be gradually added and built up within these folders as the project progresses.

## Project Overview

A React Native mobile app that allows users to select multiple locations on an interactive map and view a dynamic compass showing directional indicators pointing toward each selected location.

## Technology Stack

-   **React Native with Expo** - Mobile app framework with fast prototyping
-   **React Native Reusables** - Primary UI component library with Tailwind CSS integration
-   **react-native-maps** - Display interactive map and location pins
-   **expo-location** - Access GPS location of the user
-   **expo-sensors (Magnetometer)** - Access device compass heading
-   **AsyncStorage** - Local storage for saved locations
-   **react-navigation** - Multi-screen navigation (map, compass, etc.)
-   **react-native-svg** - Drawing compass and multiple indicators
-   **react-native-reanimated** - Smooth compass and UI animations
-   **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling (via React Native Reusables)
